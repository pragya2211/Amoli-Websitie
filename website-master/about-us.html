								<a href="https://www.amolitrust.com">Amoli</a></b>, meaning ‘precious’ is an NGO started
								by 8 college
								students, which educates children about the abnormality of
								Child Sexual Abuse prevailing in the society and helps in
								protection of their innocence. We aim at making them
								courageous and strong enough to not only protect themselves
								from this social evil, but also stand against it if needed. We
								inculcate in them the thought that it is not their fault and that
								they should come out strongly against the wrong. We ensure
								that the children do not engage in <b>self-shame</b>, <b>self-blame</b> and
								<b>self-harm.</b></p>
							<b style="font-size: 16px">‘I didn’t know I was sexually abused until I found out what
								it was’</b>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify">At present, Amoli is focussing on spreading
								awareness among
								government school children where there is lack of education
								among the masses. Generally, the children here belong to
								impoverished families where parents go paranoid and awkward
								while communicating about CSA openly. Thus, we step in to
								edify these children about CSA using inquisitive techniques in
								our sessions.</p>

						<h2 align="center">Why?</h2>
						<div class="col-md-5">
							<img src="images/amoli/new/g1.JPG" class="img-responsive abt-img">
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-7">

							<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify"><b>‘I would trade anything in the world to get
									those few
									minutes of my childhood back.’</b> With hopeful hearts and minds, yet to be nurtured
								with the
								sense of fair and foul, the little kids come up with such heart
								wrenching statements that it has become a necessity to help
								them feel safe.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify">CSA is the erotic use of a child whether
								physically or
								emotionally, and their sexual exploitation in the fullest
								meaning of the term, even if no bodily contact is ever made.
								According to a survey, the ratio of child victims to adult
								victims is <i>3:1</i>.
								CSA not only demolishes the innocence of childhood, but also
								scars their adulthood. Studies have observed that most of the
								times, victims themselves become the abusers.
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p style="font-size: 16px;" align="justify">This makes it
								important for us to help children differentiate between good
								and bad touch, and to encourage them to speak boldly without
								any shame, in the earlier phase itself. The trauma of sexual abuse may heal physically,
								but emotional
								trauma endures throughout life, thereby hampering their
								performance as an individual. This creates a strong urge in us
								to educate them about it because <b>‘When you are aware, you
									dare’.</b></p>

							<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify"><b>‘The bruises may have gone away, but the pain
									remains’</b>
								Amoli conducts two sessions per school - one session
								explaining the basics and the second one in which we dwell
								into more details. The interactive session is conducted weekly
								for an hour for children below the age of thirteen. We have
								covered over 1000 kids so far. We talk about prevention and
								teach the little kids that they are masters of their own bodies
								and talking, touching or even looking at their genitals or
								‘danger zones’ is wrong. Being little, the kids are prone to get
								scared and take our teachings in an extreme sense. This is why
								we play games and tell them stories in order to make them
								sympathetic towards the topic.</p>

						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p style="font-size: 16px" align="justify">We pledge to eradicate within
								them senses of self-harm, self-blame and self-shame so that
								they are filled with courage to talk about the same. We play, act
								and shout along with them inducing in them a sense of
								belongingness and connectivity which makes them catch up on
								the concept fast and steady. Slogans are recited so that each one
								is imprinted with the fact that <b>‘I am unique and have full
									right on my body’.</b></p>

							<p style="font-size: 16px;" align="justify">Amoli thrives to educate children about the
								abnormality of
								Child Sexual Abuse and to make the world a better place for
								them. We at Amoli visualise a society in which each and every

								proper knowledge of protecting themselves from it.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<p style="font-size: 16px;" align="justify">We not
								only impart knowledge but are also all ears if a child wants to
								share their experience with us. Researches say that 35% of
								children are victims of sexual abuse. We aim to reduce this
								number and envision to create a community that understands
								the rights of children and to provide a “CSA- free”
								environment to them. By the end of May 2019 we aim to
								cover more than 50 schools in New Delhi and thus impacting
								over 6000 students.</p>
